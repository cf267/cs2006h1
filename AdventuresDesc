In adventure.hs we separated parsed actions and moves in the process function, allowing us to convert strings to objects and directions where applicable, as required in the specification. Additionally single words that are passed (i.e. commands) are handled separately as they take
neither a direction or a command. The repl function uses the haskeline library to output to, and input from the user, as well as checking multiple conditions to check in which circumstance the game has ended. If the game has not ended then repl will call itself, meaning the game will continue to run until it reaches a win or lose condition. The tokeniseWords function takes a string, and using functions defined within parsing.hs, convert this string into individual words. This essentially performs exactly the same task as the words function which had been previously used. It is achieved by specifying the parser used in the wordParser function
